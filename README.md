## Recommendations
To follow along with me during the labs I suggest you have the following ready:

- A Linux virtual machine (Recommended: Debian, Ubuntu Desktop, or Fedora workstation) 

  Minimum 1 CPU and 1 GB RAM (Recommended: 2 CPUs and 4 GB RAM)

  Update the system: 

    Debian/Ubuntu: `apt update && apt upgrade -y`

    Fedora: `dnf update -y`

  > Note: I suggest using VirtualBox, VMware Workstation, KVM or Proxmox for your virtual machines. 

- Access to a terminal for your operating system. 

  > Note: I'll be using Tilix and the built-in gnome-terminal in Linux. See the links in the **Resources** section below for details on how to install and use Tilix.

- Access to a text editor (such as Vim or nano) or Visual Studio Code installed.

- (Optional) An AWS account with a separate IAM user (with **admin** permissions) for lab purposes

> Note: !!! Creating infrastructure on AWS or other cloud providers can incur a cost. Do not apply infrastructure if you do not want to be charged. 
> Amazon allows 750 hours of virtual machine usage (per month) on qualifying free tiers at AWS. Make sure that your region and AMI are part of the free tier program. For a pre-cost analysis see this link: https://calculator.aws

- Two or more monitors (or a second system) to display additional resources
